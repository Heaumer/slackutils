# Description
Some tools for slackware.

# current.sh
Deprecated script to maintain an up-to-date system,
mainly intended to follow -current.

Use slackpkg instead.

# mkdirinst
Install a slackware to a given directory.
If the directory happens to match a mounted partition,
also generated a basic /etc/fstab.

Packages installed are choosen from templates/base.

* templates/base.APP : packages tagged as mandatory
* templates/base.REC : packages tagged as recommanded
* templates/base : APP and REC, minor adjustements (no emacs, bc to build kernel,
  wget for slackpkg, few ones for morpheus, etc.)

# kerninst
Install a previously compiled kernel to boot and redo
the usual symlink in /boot.

# slackup
Use slackpkg to maintain an up-to-date system.

# xchroot
Bind dev, pts, etc. to the chroot directory if not already;
get resolv.conf and chroot.

# mkiso
